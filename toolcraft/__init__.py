Top-level package for toolcraft.

Resolving __version__
  + This cannot be hardcoded also the external setup files are not shipped so we use this solution
    https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/pull/2366#issuecomment-652418094
  + Read the discussion here as to why this is so tedious
    https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/pull/2366#issuecomment-652418094
  + Note that bump2version tends to modify the string so always use poetry

todo: find a way to get info in `pyproject.toml` to update this file so we have project info inside the code.
  + This needs to be automated and the source code should be updated here before release happens. This is done by
    bump2version but poetry doesnt seem to support it .... doing this will allow us to get packaging
    information inside code.
  + Or else we have to rely on importlib which has some packaging info when poetry packaged it...
  + Watch this space and do if needed
  + See the author and email info here ... it looks ugly to update it ...
  + We might want it as in sphinx documentation we can access this variables
