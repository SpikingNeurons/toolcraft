  abstract = {TensorFlow is an interface for expressing machine learning algorithms, and an implementation for executing such algorithms. A computation expressed using TensorFlow can be executed with little or no change on a wide variety of heterogeneous systems, ranging from mobile devices such as phones and tablets up to large-scale distributed systems of hundreds of machines and thousands of computational devices such as GPU cards. The system is flexible and can be used to express a wide variety of algorithms, including training and inference algorithms for deep neural network models, and it has been used for conducting research and for deploying machine learning systems into production across more than a dozen areas of computer science and other fields, including speech recognition, computer vision, robotics, information retrieval, natural language processing, geographic information extraction, and computational drug discovery. This paper describes the TensorFlow interface and an implementation of that interface that we have built at Google. The TensorFlow API and a reference implementation were released as an open-source package under the Apache 2.0 license in November, 2015 and are available at www.tensorflow.org.},

Note: The animations below are videos. Touch or hover on them (if you're using a mouse) to get play controls so you can pause if needed. Sequence-to-sequence models are deep learning models that have achieved a lot of success in tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and image captioning. Google Translate started using such a model in production in late 2016. These models are explained in the two pioneering papers (Sutskever et al., 2014, Cho et al., 2014). I found, however, that understanding the model well enough to implement it requires unraveling a series of concepts that build on top of each other. I thought that a bunch of these ideas would be more accessible if expressed visually. That's what I aim to do in this post. You'll need some previous understanding of deep learning to get through this post. I hope it can be a useful companion to reading the papers mentioned above (and the attention papers linked later in the post). A sequence-to-sequence model is a model that takes a sequence of items (words, letters, features of an images\ldots etc) and outputs another sequence of items.

Though this is a realistic assumption, numerical problems are likely to occur in practice due to evaluation in higher dimensions. To avoid this, a feature selection is applied to identify points in time that contribute most information to an attack. An alternative to common template attacks is to apply machine learning in form of support vector machines (SVMs). Recent works brought out approaches that produce comparable results, respectively better in the presence of noise, but still not optimal in terms of efficiency and performance. In this work we show how to adapt the SVM template approach in order to considerably reduce the effort while carrying out the attack and how to better exploit the side-channel information under the assumption of an attack model with a strict order, e.g. Hamming weight model.},

Side-channel attacks (SCAs) are powerful attacks based on the information obtained from the implementation of cryptographic devices. Profiling side-channel attacks has received a lot of attention in recent years due to the fact that this type of attack defines the worst-case security assumptions. The SCA community realized that the same approach is actually used in other domains in the form of supervised machine learning. Consequently, some researchers started experimenting with different machine learning techniques and evaluating their effectiveness in the SCA context. More recently, we are witnessing an increase in the use of deep learning techniques in the SCA community with strong first results in side-channel analyses, even in the presence of countermeasures. In this chapter, we consider the evolution of profiling attacks, and subsequently we discuss the impacts they have made in the data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification phases. We also speculate on the future directions and the best-case consequences for the security of small devices.}

  abstract = {In the context of the security evaluation of cryptographic implementations, profiling attacks (aka Template Attacks) play a fundamental role. Nowadays the most popular Template Attack strategy consists in approximating the information leakages by Gaussian distributions. Nevertheless this approach suffers from the difficulty to deal with both the traces misalignment and the high dimensionality of the data. This forces the attacker to perform critical preprocessing phases, such as the selection of the points of interest and the realignment of measurements. Some software and hardware countermeasures have been conceived exactly to create such a misalignment. In this paper we propose an end-to-end profiling attack strategy based on the Convolutional Neural Networks: this strategy greatly facilitates the attack roadmap, since it does not require a previous trace realignment nor a precise selection of points of interest. To significantly increase the performances of the CNN, we moreover propose to equip it with the data augmentation technique that is classical in other applications of Machine Learning. As a validation, we present several experiments against traces misaligned by different kinds of countermeasures, including the augmentation of the clock jitter effect in a secure hardware implementation over a modern chip. The excellent results achieved in these experiments prove that Convolutional Neural Networks approach combined with data augmentation gives a very efficient alternative to the state-of-the-art profiling attacks.},

We derive a particular form of contrastive loss named Joint Contrastive Learning (JCL). JCL implicitly involves the simultaneous learning of an infinite number of query-key pairs, which poses tighter constraints when searching for invariant features. We derive an upper bound on this formulation that allows analytical solutions in an end-to-end training manner. While JCL is practically effective in numerous computer vision applications, we also theoretically unveil the certain mechanisms that govern the behavior of JCL. We demonstrate that the proposed formulation harbors an innate agency that strongly favors similarity within each instance-specific class, and therefore remains advantageous when searching for discriminative features among distinct instances. We evaluate these proposals on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating considerable improvements over existing algorithms.

These attacks can break implementations and countermeasures whose security is dependent on the assumption that an adversary cannot obtain more than one or a limited number of side channel samples. They require that an adversary has access to an identical experimental device that he can program to his choosing. The success of these attacks in such constraining situations is due manner in which noise within each sample is handled. In contrast to previous approaches which viewed noise as a hindrance that had to be reduced or eliminated, our approach focuses on precisely modeling noise, and using this to fully extract information present in a single sample. We describe in detail how an implementation of RC4, not amenable to techniques such as SPA and DPA, can easily be broken using template attacks with a single sample. Other applications include attacks on certain DES implementations which use DPA-resistant hardware and certain SSL accelerators which can be attacked by monitoring electromagnetic emanations from an RSA operation even from distances of fifteen feet.},

  abstract = {The proliferation of ubiquitous computing requires energy-efficient as well as secure operation of modern processors. Side channel attacks are becoming a critical threat to security and privacy of devices embedded in modern computing infrastructures. Unintended information leakage via physical signatures such as power consumption, electromagnetic emission (EM) and execution time have emerged as a key security consideration for SoCs. Also, information published on purpose at user privilege level accessible through software interfaces results in software-only attacks. In this paper, we used a supervised learning based approach for inferring applications executing on android platform based on features extracted from EM side-channel emissions and software exposed dynamic voltage frequency scaling (DVFS) states. We highlight the importance of machine learning based approach in utilizing these multi-dimensional features on a complex SoC, against profiling-based approaches. We also show that learning the instantaneous frequency states polled from on-board frequency driver (cpufreq) is adequate to identify a known application and flag potentially malicious unknown application. The experimental results on benchmarking applications running on ARMv8 processor in Snapdragon 820 board demonstrates early detection of these apps in 700 ms, and atleast 85\% accuracy in detecting unknown applications. Overall, the highlight is to utilize a low-complexity path to application inference attacks through learning instantaneous frequency states pattern of CPU core.},

These acoustic emanations are more than a nuisance: They can convey information about the software running on the computer and, in particular, leak sensitive information about security-related computations. In a preliminary presentation (Eurocrypt'04 rump session), we have shown that different RSA keys induce different sound patterns, but it was not clear how to extract individual key bits. The main problem was the very low bandwidth of the acoustic side channel (under 20~~kHz using common microphones, and a few hundred kHz using ultrasound microphones), and several orders of magnitude below the GHz-scale clock rates of the attacked computers. In this paper, we describe a new acoustic cryptanalysis key extraction attack, applicable to GnuPG's implementation of RSA. The attack can extract full 4096-bit RSA decryption keys from laptop computers (of various models), within an hour, using the sound generated by the computer during the decryption of some chosen ciphertexts. We experimentally demonstrate such attacks, using a plain mobile phone placed next to the computer, or a more sensitive microphone placed 10 meters away.},

  abstract = {The appearance of deep neural networks for Side-Channel leads to strong power analysis techniques for detecting secret information of physical cryptography implementations. Generally, deep learning techniques do not suffer the difficulties of template attacks such as trace misalignment. However, the generalization of a trained deep neural network that can accurately predict Side-Channel leakages largely depends on its adjustable variables (parameters of a neural network). Although pre-training is no longer mandatory, it is needed for parameter selection of a deep neural network to improve the success rate and provide a better insight into the network's inner functionality. In this paper, we propose a novel model via Twin support vector with a deep kernel approach when targeting a hardware implementation of AES-128. The proposed model is pre-trained with the Restricted Boltzmann Machine method in a layer-wise manner and then fine-tuned via gradient descent. Further, we used the grid search technique for the selection of each hyperparameter which is used to compute class probabilities of every test trace in our deep model based side-channel attack. Based on our analysis and experiments, this model empirically shows its effectiveness by outperforming some of its competitors in profiling attack methods such as convolutional neural networks and multilayer perceptron models. We also evaluate our model on both masked and unmasked AES implementation. The results indicate that the proposed approach has achieved a success rate of greater than 99\% even with a single trace using Keras library with Tensorflow. We investigate the correct ``key rank'' according to the number of traces; our model reaches the key \$ rank\textbackslash leq 10 \$ when attacking the third AES SBox.},

We propose the use of a pre-processing step using principal component analysis (PCA) to significantly increase the success of the attack. We have developed a classifier that can correctly identify the mask for each trace, hence removing the security provided by that mask and reducing the attack to being equivalent to an attack against an unprotected implementation. The attack is performed on the freely available differential power analysis (DPA) contest data set to allow our work to be easily reproducible.

  abstract = {With the rise of Transformers as the standard for language processing, and their advancements in computer vision, along with their unprecedented size and amounts of training data, many have come to believe that they are not suitable for small sets of data. This trend leads to great concerns, including but not limited to: limited availability of data in certain scientific domains and the exclusion of those with limited resource from research in the field. In this paper, we dispel the myth that transformers are "data hungry" and therefore can only be applied to large sets of data. We show for the first time that with the right size and tokenization, transformers can perform head-to-head with state-of-the-art CNNs on small datasets, often with better accuracy and fewer parameters. Our model eliminates the requirement for class token and positional embeddings through a novel sequence pooling strategy and the use of convolution/s. It is flexible in terms of model size, and can have as little as 0.28M parameters while achieving good results. Our model can reach 98.00\% accuracy when training from scratch on CIFAR-10, which is a significant improvement over previous Transformer based models. It also outperforms many modern CNN based approaches, such as ResNet, and even some recent NAS-based approaches, such as Proxyless-NAS. Our simple and compact design democratizes transformers by making them accessible to those with limited computing resources and/or dealing with small datasets. Our method also works on larger datasets, such as ImageNet (82.71\% accuracy with 29\% parameters of ViT), and NLP tasks as well.

We use a target-based classification to differentiate published work and drive general conclusions according to a common machine learning workflow. Furthermore, we outline the relationship between traditional power analysis techniques and machine learning-based attacks. This enables researchers to gain a better understanding of the topic in order to design new attack methods as well as potential countermeasures.},

  abstract = {Evaluation of cryptographic implementations against profiled side-channel attacks plays a fundamental role in security testing nowadays. Recently, deep neural networks and especially Convolutional Neural Networks have been introduced as a new tool for that purpose. Although having several practical advantages over common Gaussian templates such as intrinsic feature extraction, the deep-learning-based profiling techniques proposed in literature still require a suitable leakage model for the implementation under test. Since this is a crucial task, we are introducing domain knowledge to exploit the full power of approximating very complex functions with neural networks. By doing so, we are able to attack the secret key directly without any assumption about the leakage behavior. Our experiments confirmed that our method is much more efficient than state-of-the-art profiling approaches when targeting an unprotected hardware and a protected software implementation of the AES.},

For non-Gaussian noise, we obtain different optimal distinguishers, one for each noise distribution. When the model is imperfectly known, we consider the scenario of a weighted sum of the sensitive variable bits where the weights are unknown and drawn from a normal law.

We compare the SVM attack to the template attack by evaluating the number of required traces in the attack phase to achieve a fixed guessing entropy. In order to highlight the benefits of the SVM attack, we perform the comparison for power traces with a varying noise level and vary the size of the profiling base. Our experiments indicate that due to the generalization of SVM the SVM attack is able to recover the key using a smaller profiling base than the template attack.

  abstract = {Side-channel attacks represent a powerful category of attacks against cryptographic devices. Still, side-channel analysis for lightweight ciphers is much less investigated than for instance for AES. Although intuition may lead to the conclusion that lightweight ciphers are weaker in terms of side-channel resistance, that remains to be confirmed and quantified. In this paper, we consider various side-channel analysis metrics which should provide an insight on the resistance of lightweight ciphers against side-channel attacks. In particular, for the non-profiled scenario we use the theoretical confusion coefficient and empirical optimal distinguisher. Our study considers side-channel attacks on the first, the last, or both rounds simultaneously. Furthermore, we conduct a profiled side-channel analysis using various machine learning attacks to recover 4-bit and 8-bit intermediate states of the cipher. Our results show that the difference between AES and lightweight ciphers is smaller than one would expect, and even find scenarios in which lightweight ciphers may be more resistant. Interestingly, we observe that the studied 4-bit S-boxes have a different side-channel resilience, while the difference in the 8-bit ones is only theoretically present.},

Side-channel analysis (SCA) is an alternative attack that exploits information leaking from physical implementations of e.g. cryptographic devices to discover cryptographic keys or other secrets. This work comprehensively investigates the application of a machine learning technique in SCA. The considered technique is a powerful kernel-based learning algorithm: the Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM). The chosen side-channel is the power consumption and the target is a software implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard. In this study, the LS-SVM technique is compared to Template Attacks. The results show that the choice of parameters of the machine learning technique strongly impacts the performance of the classification. In contrast, the number of power traces and time instants does not influence the results in the same proportion. This effect can be attributed to the usage of data sets with straightforward Hamming weight leakages in this first study.},

The previous work has shown that CNNs have the potential of breaking the cryptographic algorithm protected with masking or desynchronization. Before, several CNN models have been exploited, reaching the same or even better level of performance compared to the traditional side-channel attack (SCA). In this paper, we investigate the architecture of Residual Network and build a new CNN model called attention network. To enhance the power of the attention network, we introduce an attention mechanism - Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and incorporate CBAM into the CNN architecture. CBAM points out the informative points of the input traces and makes the attention network focus on the relevant leakages of the measurements. It is able to improve the performance of the CNNs. Because the irrelevant points will introduce the extra noises and cause a worse performance of attacks. We compare our attention network with the one designed for the masking AES implementation called ASCAD network in this paper. We show that the attention network has a better performance than the ASCAD network. Finally, a new visualization method, named Class Gradient Visualization (CGV) is proposed to recognize which points of the input traces have a positive influence on the predicted result of the neural networks. In another aspect, it can explain why the attention network is superior to the ASCAD network. We validate the attention network through extensive experiments on four public datasets and demonstrate that the attention network is efficient in different AES implementations.},

Thanks to its capability in dealing with raw features and countermeasures, it becomes the de facto standard evaluation method for the evaluation labs/certification schemes. To reach this performance level, recent works significantly improved the deep learning-based attacks from various perspectives, like hyperparameter tuning, design guidelines, or custom neural network architecture elements. Still, limited attention has been given to the core of the learning process - the loss function. This paper analyzes the limitations of the existing loss functions and then proposes a novel side-channel analysis-optimized loss function: Focal Loss Ratio (FLR), to cope with the identified drawbacks observed in other loss functions. To validate our design, we 1) conduct a thorough experimental study considering various scenarios (datasets, leakage models, neural network architectures) and 2) compare with other loss functions commonly used in the deep learning-based side-channel analysis (both ``traditional'' one and those designed for side-channel analysis). Our results show that FLR loss outperforms other loss functions in various conditions while not having computation overheads compared to common loss functions like categorical cross-entropy.},

The results, although scarce for now, suggest that such techniques are even able to break cryptographic implementations protected with countermeasures. In this paper, we start by proposing a new Convolutional Neural Network instance able to reach high performance for a number of considered datasets. We compare our neural network with the one designed for a particular dataset with masking countermeasure and we show that both are good designs but also that neither can be considered as a superior to the other one.Next, we address how the addition of artificial noise to the input signal can be actually beneficial to the performance of the neural network. Such noise addition is equivalent to the regularization term in the objective function. By using this technique, we are able to reduce the number of measurements needed to reveal the secret key by orders of magnitude for both neural networks. Our new convolutional neural network instance with added noise is able to break the implementation protected with the random delay countermeasure by using only 3 traces in the attack phase. To further strengthen our experimental results, we investigate the performance with a varying number of training samples, noise levels, and epochs. Our findings show that adding noise is beneficial throughout all training set sizes and epochs.},

  abstract = {In the field of image recognition, machine learning technologies, especially deep learning, have been rapidly advancing alongside the advances of hardware such as GPUs. In image recognition, in general, large numbers of labeled images to be identified are input to a neural network, and repeatedly learning the images enables the neural network to identify objects with high accuracy. A new profiling side-channel attack method, the deep learning side-channel attack (DL-SCA), utilizes the neural network's high identifying ability to unveil a cryptographic module's secret key from side-channel information. In DL-SCAs, the neural network is trained with power waveforms captured from a target cryptographic module, and the trained network extracts the leaky part that depends on the secret. However, at this stage, the main target of investigation has been software implementation, and studies regarding hardware implementation, such as ASIC, are somewhat lacking. In this paper, we first depict deep learning techniques, profiling side-channel attacks, and leak models to clarify the relation between secret and side channels. Next, we investigate the use of DL-SCA against hardware implementations of AES and discuss the problem derived from the Hamming distance model and ShiftRow operation of AES. To solve the problem, we propose a new network training method called ``mixed model dataset based on round-round XORed value.'' We prove that our proposal solves the problem and gives the attack capability to neural networks. We also compare the attack performance and characteristics of DL-SCA to conventional analysis methods such as correlation power analysis and conventional template attack. In our experiment, a dedicated ASIC chip for side-channel analysis is utilized and the chip is also equipped with a side-channel countermeasure AES. We show how DL-SCA can recover secret keys against the side-channel countermeasure circuit. Our results demonstrate that DL-SCA can be a more powerful option against side-channel countermeasure implementations than conventional SCAs.},

Side-channel attacks challenge the security of cryptographic devices. One of the widespread countermeasures against these attacks is the masking approach. In 2012, Nassar et al. [21] presented a new lightweight (low-cost) Boolean masking countermeasure to protect the implementation of the AES block-cipher. This masking scheme represents the target algorithm of the DPAContest V4 [30]. In this article, we present the first machine learning attack against a masking countermeasure, using the dataset of the DPAContest V4. We succeeded to extract each targeted byte of the key of the masked AES with \textbackslash (26\textbackslash ) traces during the attacking phase. This number of traces represents roughly twice the number of traces needed compared to an unmasked AES on the same cryptographic device. Finally, we compared our proposal to a stochastic attack and to a strategy based on template attack. We showed that an attack based on a machine learning model reduces the number of traces required during the attacking step with a factor two and four compared respectively to template attack and to stochastic attack when analyzing the same leakage information. A new strategy based on stochastic attack reduces this number to 27.8 traces (in average) during the attack but requires a larger execution time in our setting than a learning model.},

First and from a theoretic point of view, the data complexity of template attacks is not sensitive to the dimension increase in side-channel traces given that their profiling is perfect. Second and from a practical point of view, concrete attacks are always affected by (estimation and assumption) errors during profiling. As these errors increase, machine learning gains interest compared to template attacks, especially when based on random forests.

With local attention, we achieve a significant gain of 5.0 BLEU points over non-attentional systems which already incorporate known techniques such as dropout. Our ensemble model using different attention architectures has established a new state-of-the-art result in the WMT'15 English to German translation task with 25.9 BLEU points, an improvement of 1.0 BLEU points over the existing best system backed by NMT and an n-gram reranker.},

Many papers have recently investigated the abilities of deep learning in profiling traces. Some of them also aim at the countermeasures (e.g., masking) simultaneously. Nevertheless, so far, all of these papers work with an (implicit) assumption that the number of time samples in raw traces can be reduced before the profiling, i.e., the position of points of interest (PoIs) can be manually located. This is arguably the most challenging part of a practical black-box analysis targeting an implementation protected by masking. Therefore, we argue that to fully utilize the potential of deep learning and get rid of any manual intervention, the end-to-end profiling directly mapping raw traces to target intermediate values is demanded.In this paper, we propose a neural network architecture that consists of encoders, attention mechanisms and a classifier, to conduct the end-to-end profiling. The networks built by our architecture could directly classify the traces that contain a large number of time samples (i.e., raw traces without manual feature extraction) while whose underlying implementation is protected by masking. We validate our networks on several public datasets, i.e., DPA contest v4 and ASCAD, where over 100,000 time samples are directly used in profiling. To our best knowledge, we are the first that successfully carry out end-to-end profiling attacks. The results on the datasets indicate that our networks could get rid of the tricky manual feature extraction. Moreover, our networks perform even systematically better (w.r.t. the number of traces in attacks) than those trained on the reduced traces. These validations imply our approach is not only a first but also a concrete step towards end-to-end profiling attacks in the side-channel context.},

The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images ofobjects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualizations produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.},

  abstract = {This work argues that applying DL-SCA to target a bigger chunk of the key without introducing a learning time overhead and while guaranteeing a similar attack efficiency compared to the commonly used training strategy, and shows that the methodology is even faster than the classical training and leads to a more efficient key recovery phase. Deep Learning based Side-Channel Attacks (DL-SCA) are an emerging security assessment method increasingly being adopted by the majority of certification schemes and certification bodies to assess the resistance of cryptographic implementations. The related published investigations have demonstrated that DL-SCA are very efficient when targeting cryptographic designs protected with the common side-channel countermeasures. Furthermore, these attacks allow to streamline the evaluation process as the pre-processing of the traces (e.g. alignment, dimensionality reduction, . . . ) is no longer mandatory. In practice, the DL-SCA are applied following the divide-and-conquer strategy such that the target, for the training and the attack phases, only depends on 8 key bits at most (to avoid high time complexity especially during the training). Then, the same process is repeated to recover the remaining bits of the key. To mitigate this practical issue, we propose in this work a new profiling methodology for DL-SCA based on the so-called multi-label classification. We argue that our new profiling methodology allows applying DL-SCA to target a bigger chunk of the key (typically 16 bits) without introducing a learning time overhead and while guaranteeing a similar attack efficiency compared to the commonly used training strategy. As a side benefit, we demonstrate that our leaning strategy can be applied as well to train several intermediate operations at once. Interestingly, we show that, in this context, our methodology is even faster than the classical training and leads to a more efficient key recovery phase. We validated the soundness of our proposal on simulated traces and experimental data-sets; amongst them, some are publicly available side-channel databases. The obtained results have proven that our profiling methodology is of great practical interest especially in the context of performing penetration tests with high attack potential (e.g. Common Criteria, EMVCO) where the time required to perform the attack has an impact on its final rating.}

This way of the power analysis is an entirely new approach and it is designed to combine the advantages of simple and differential power analysis. In the extreme case, this feature allows to determine the whole secret key of a cryptographic module only from one measured power trace.

  abstract = {In recent years, deep learning has become an attractive ingredient to side-channel analysis (SCA) due to its potential to improve the success probability or enhance the performance of certain frequently executed tasks. One task that is commonly assisted by machine learning techniques is the profiling of a device's leakage behavior in order to carry out a template attack. At CHES 2019, deep learning has also been applied to non-profiled scenarios for the first time, extending its reach within SCA beyond template attacks. The proposed method, called DDLA, has some tempting advantages over traditional SCA due to merits inherited from (convolutional) neural networks. Most notably, it greatly reduces the need for pre-processing steps when the SCA traces are misaligned or when the leakage is of a multivariate nature. However, similar to traditional attack scenarios the success of this approach highly depends on the correct choice of a leakage model and the intermediate value to target. In this work we explore, for the first time in literature, whether deep learning can similarly be used as an instrument to advance another crucial (non-profiled) discipline of SCA which is inherently independent of leakage models and targeted intermediates, namely leakage assessment. In fact, given the simple classification-based nature of common leakage assessment techniques, in particular distinguishing two groups fixed-vs-random or fixed-vs-fixed, it comes as a surprise that machine learning has not been brought into this context, yet. Our contribution is the development of the first full leakage assessment methodology based on deep learning. It gives the evaluator the freedom to not worry about location, alignment and statistical order of the leakages and easily covers multivariate and horizontal patterns as well. We test our approach against a number of case studies based on FPGA, ASIC and \textmu C implementations of the PRESENT block cipher, equipped with state-of-the-art SCA countermeasures. Our results clearly show that the proposed methodology and network structures are robust across all case studies and outperform the classical detection approaches (\$t\$-test and \$\textbackslash chi\^2\$-test) in all considered scenarios.},

This is due, in part, to their computational efficiency, relative to recurrent neural networks and their ability to efficiently exploit certain temporal invariances, (e.g., phase invariance). However, it is well-established that clinical data may exhibit many other types of invariances (e.g., scaling). While preprocessing techniques, (e.g., dynamic time warping) may successfully transform and align inputs, their use often requires one to identify the types of invariances in advance. In contrast, we propose the use of Sequence Transformer Networks, an end-to-end trainable architecture that learns to identify and account for invariances in clinical time-series data. Applied to the task of predicting in-hospital mortality, our proposed approach achieves an improvement in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) relative to a baseline CNN (AUROC=0.851 vs. AUROC=0.838). Our results suggest that a variety of valuable invariances can be learned directly from the data.},

  abstract = {One of the main promoted advantages of deep learning in profiling side-channel analysis is the possibility of skipping the feature engineering process. Despite that, most recent publications consider feature selection as the attacked interval from the side-channel measurements is pre-selected. This is similar to the worst-case security assumptions in security evaluations when the random secret shares (e.g., mask shares) are known during the profiling phase: an evaluator can identify points of interest locations and efficiently trim the trace interval. To broadly understand how feature selection impacts the performance of deep learning-based profiling attacks, this paper investigates four different feature selection scenarios that could be realistically used in practical security evaluations. The scenarios range from the minimum possible number of features to the whole available trace samples. Our results emphasize that deep neural networks as profiling models show successful key recovery independently of explored feature selection scenarios against first-order masked software implementations of AES 128. Concerning the number of features, we found three main observations: 1) scenarios with less carefully selected point-of-interest and larger attacked trace intervals are the ones with better attack performance in terms of the required number of traces during the attack phase; 2) optimizing and reducing the number of features does not necessarily improve the chances to find good models from the hyperparameter search; and 3) in all explored feature selection scenarios, the random hyperparameter search always indicate a successful model with a single hidden layer for MLPs and two hidden layers for CNNs, which questions the reason for using complex models for the considered datasets. Our results demonstrate the key recovery with a single attack trace for all datasets for at least one of the feature selection scenarios.},

  abstract = {The adoption of deep neural networks for profiled side-channel attacks provides powerful options for leakage detection and key retrieval of secure products. When training a neural network for side-channel analysis, it is expected that the trained model can implement an approximation function that can detect leaking side-channel samples and, at the same time, be insensible to noisy (or non-leaking) samples. This outlines a generalization situation where the model can identify the main representations learned from the training set in a separate test set.This paper discusses how output class probabilities represent a strong metric when conducting the side-channel analysis. Further, we observe that these output probabilities are sensitive to small changes, like selecting specific test traces or weight initialization for a neural network. Next, we discuss the hyperparameter tuning, where one commonly uses only a single out of dozens of trained models, where each of those models will result in different output probabilities. We show how ensembles of machine learning models based on averaged class probabilities can improve generalization. Our results emphasize that ensembles increase a profiled side-channel attack's performance and reduce the variance of results stemming from different hyperparameters, regardless of the selected dataset or leakage model.},

In fact, if comparing techniques without extra steps like preprocessing, we see an obvious advantage for convolutional neural networks only when the level of noise is small, and the number of measurements and features is high. The other tested settings show that simpler machine learning techniques, for a significantly lower computational cost, perform similar or even better. The experiments with the guessing entropy metric indicate that simpler methods like Random forest or XGBoost perform better than convolu-tional neural networks for the datasets we investigated.

Profiled side-channel attacks feature a number of steps one needs to take. One significant step, importance of which is sometimes ignored, is selection of the points of interest (features) within side-channel measurement traces. A large majority of the related works on profiling in side-channel analysis starts with an assumption that the features are somehow selected and distinct attack methods are compared in order to find the best approach for the key recovery. Contrary to this, in this work we concentrate on the feature selection step and show that if an optimal selection is done, most of the attack techniques perform well i.e., result in the key recovery. Consequently, in this paper, we investigate in details how more advanced feature selection techniques stemming from the machine learning domain can be used to improve the attack efficiency. To this end, we look into relevant aspects and we provide a systematic evaluation of machine learning methods of interest. Our results show that the so-called Hybrid feature selection methods perform with the best classification accuracy over a wide range of test scenarios and number of features selected. The experiments are performed on several real-world data sets containing software and hardware implementations of AES, and even including the random delay countermeasure. We emphasize the L1 regularization technique, which consistently performed well and in many cases resulted in significantly higher accuracy than the second best technique. Further on, we consider even Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a typical dimensionality reduction method and show that feature selection combined with the ML classification remains the method of choice (when confronted with PCA).}

  abstract = {The field of side-channel analysis has made significant progress over time. Side-channel analysis is now used in practice in design companies as well as in test laboratories, and the security of products against side-channel attacks has significantly improved. However, there are still some remaining issues to be solved for side-channel analysis to become more effective. Side-channel analysis consists of two steps, commonly referred to as identification and exploitation. The identification consists of understanding the leakage and building suitable models. The exploitation consists of using the identified leakage models to extract the secret key. In scenarios where the model is poorly known, it can be approximated in a profiling phase. There, machine learning techniques are gaining value. In this paper, we conduct extensive analysis of several machine learning techniques, showing the importance of proper parameter tuning and training. In contrast to what is perceived as common knowledge in unrestricted scenarios, we show that some machine learning techniques can significantly outperform template attacks when properly used. We therefore stress that the traditional worst case security assessment of cryptographic implementations, that mainly includes template attacks, might not be accurate enough. Besides that, we present a new measure called the Data Confusion Factor that can be used to assess how well machine learning techniques will perform on a certain dataset.},

Side-channel attacks represent a realistic and serious threat to the security of embedded devices for almost three decades. The variety of attacks and targets they can be applied to have been introduced, and while the area of side-channel attacks and mitigations is very well-researched, it is yet to be consolidated. Deep learning-based side-channel attacks entered the field in recent years with the promise of more competitive performance and enlarged attackers' capabilities compared to other techniques. At the same time, the new attacks bring new challenges and complexities to the domain, making a systematization of the existing knowledge ever more necessary. In this SoK, we do exactly that, and by bringing new insights, we systematically structure the current knowledge of deep learning in side-channel analysis. We first dissect deep learning-assisted attacks into different phases and map those phases to the efforts conducted so far in the domain. For each of the phases, we identify the weaknesses and challenges that triggered the known open problems. We connect the attacks to the existing threat models and evaluate their advantages and drawbacks. We finish by discussing other threat models that should be investigated and propose directions for future works.}

Side-channel attacks represent one of the most powerful category of attacks on cryptographic devices with profiled attacks in a prominent place as the most powerful among them. Indeed, for instance, template attack is a well-known real-world attack that is also the most powerful attack from the information theoretic perspective. On the other hand, machine learning techniques have proven their quality in a numerous applications where one is definitely side-channel analysis. As one could expect, most of the research concerning supervised machine learning and side-channel analysis concentrated on more powerful machine learning techniques. Although valid from the practical perspective, such attacks often remain lacking from the more theoretical side.

Existing power analysis techniques rely on strong adversary models with prior knowledge of the leakage or training data. We introduce side-channel analysis with unsupervised learning (SCAUL) that can recover the secret key without requiring prior knowledge or profiling (training). We employ an LSTM auto-encoder to extract features from power traces with high mutual information with the data-dependent samples of the measurements. We demonstrate that by replacing the raw measurements with the auto-encoder features in a classical DPA attack, the efficiency, in terms of required number of measurements for key recovery, improves by 10X. Further, we employ these features to identify a leakage model with sensitivity analysis and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) networks. SCAUL uses the auto-encoder features and the leakage model, obtained in an unsupervised approach, to find the correct key. On a lightweight implementation of AES on Artix-7 FPGA, we show that SCAUL is able to recover the correct key with 3,700 power measurements with random plaintexts, while a DPA attack requires at least 17,400 measurements. Using misaligned traces, with an uncertainty equal to 20 percent of the hardware clock cycle, SCAUL is able to recover the secret key with 12,300 measurements while the DPA attack fails to detect the key.}

The results in the last few years show that neural network architectures like multilayer perceptron and convolutional neural networks give strong attack performance where it is possible to break targets protected with various countermeasures. Considering that deep learning techniques commonly have a plethora of hyperparameters to tune, it is clear that such top attack results can come with a high price in preparing the attack. This is especially problematic as the side-channel community commonly uses random search or grid search techniques to look for the best hyperparameters.In this paper, we propose to use reinforcement learning to tune the convolutional neural network hyperparameters. In our framework, we investigate the Q-Learning paradigm and develop two reward functions that use side-channel metrics. We mount an investigation on three commonly used datasets and two leakage models where the results show that reinforcement learning can find convolutional neural networks exhibiting top performance while having small numbers of trainable parameters. We note that our approach is automated and can be easily adapted to different datasets. Several of our newly developed architectures outperform the current state-of-the-art results. Finally, we make our source code publicly available. https://github.com/AISyLab/Reinforcement-Learning-for-SCA},

Motivated by this challenge, this work makes a step in this direction and proposes a framework for the analysis of cryptographic implementations that includes a theoretical model and an application methodology. The model is based on commonly accepted hypotheses about side-channels that computations give rise to. It allows quantifying the effect of practically relevant leakage functions with a combination of information theoretic and security metrics, measuring the quality of an implementation and the strength of an adversary, respectively. From a theoretical point of view, we demonstrate formal connections between these metrics and discuss their intuitive meaning. From a practical point of view, the model implies a unified methodology for the analysis of side-channel key recovery attacks. The proposed solution allows getting rid of most of the subjective parameters that were limiting previous specialized and often ad hoc approaches in the evaluation of physically observable devices. It typically determines the extent to which basic (but practically essential) questions such as ``How to compare two implementations?'' or ``How to compare two side-channel adversaries?'' can be answered in a~sound~fashion.},

  abstract = {Deep Learning has recently been introduced as a new alternative to perform Side-Channel analysis [MPP16]. Until now, studies have been focused on applying Deep Learning techniques to perform Profiled Side-Channel attacks where an attacker has a full control of a profiling device and is able to collect a large amount of traces for different key values in order to characterize the device leakage prior to the attack. In this paper we introduce a new method to apply Deep Learning techniques in a Non-Profiled context, where an attacker can only collect a limited number of side-channel traces for a fixed unknown key value from a closed device. We show that by combining key guesses with observations of Deep Learning metrics, it is possible to recover information about the secret key. The main interest of this method is that it is possible to use the power of Deep Learning and Neural Networks in a Non-Profiled scenario. We show that it is possible to exploit the translation-invariance property of Convolutional Neural Networks [CDP17] against de-synchronized traces also during Non-Profiled side-channel attacks. In this case, we show that this method can outperform classic Non-Profiled attacks such as Correlation Power Analysis. We also highlight that it is possible to break masked implementations in black-box, without leakages combination pre-preprocessing and with no assumptions nor knowledge about the masking implementation. To carry the attack, we introduce metrics based on Sensitivity Analysis that can reveal both the secret key value as well as points of interest, such as leakages and masks locations in the traces. The results of our experiments demonstrate the interests of this new method and show that this attack can be performed in practice.},

Machine learning techniques represent a powerful option in profiling sidechannel analysis. Still, there are many settings where their performance is far from expected. In such occasions, it is very important to understand the difficulty of the problem and the behavior of the machine learning algorithm. To that end, one needs to investigate not only the performance of machine learning but also to provide insights into its explainability. One tool enabling us to do this is the bias\textendash variance decomposition where we are able to decompose the predictive error into bias, variance, and noise. With this technique, we can analyze various scenarios and recognize what are the sources of problem difficulty and how additional measurements/features or more complex machine learning models can alleviate the problem. While such results are promising, there are still drawbacks since often it is not easy to connect the performance of side-channel attack and performance of a machine learning classifier as given by the bias-variance decomposition. In this paper, we propose a new tool for analyzing the performance of machine learning-based side-channel attacks \textendash{} the Guessing Entropy Bias\textendash Variance Decomposition. With it, we are able to better understand the performance of various machine learning techniques and understand how a change in a setting influences the performance of an attack.

We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

The results show all considered techniques to be viable and powerful options. Especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are effective as we can break the implementation with only a single measurement in the attack phase while requiring less than 500 measurements in the training phase. Interestingly, that same convolutional neural network was recently shown to perform extremely well for attacking the implementation of the AES cipher.

First, by providing a better understanding on the internal workings of these models, we can trivially reduce their number of parameters on average by 52\%, while maintaining a similar performance. Second, we demonstrate that the convolutional filter's size is not strictly related to the amount of misalignment in the traces. Third, we show that increasing the filter size and the number of convolutions actually improves the performance of a network.

At the same time, the previous state-of-the-art technique, template attack, started losing its importance and was more considered a baseline to compare against. As such, most of the results reported that machine learning (and especially deep learning) could significantly outperform the template attack. Nevertheless, the template attack still has certain advantages even compared to deep learning. The most significant one is that it has only a few hyperparameters to tune, making it easier to use. We take another look at the template attack, and we devise a feature engineering phase allowing the template attack to compete or even outperform state-of-the-art deep learning-based side-channel attacks. More precisely, with a novel distance metric customized for side-channel analysis, we show how a deep learning technique called similarity learning can be used to find highly efficient embeddings of input data with one-epoch training, which can then be fed into the template attack resulting in powerful attacks.},

Numerous results in the last few years indicate neural networks can break targets protected with countermeasures even with a relatively small number of attack traces.

Current results commonly use random search and reach good performance. Yet, we remain with the question of how good are such architectures if compared with the architectures that are carefully designed by following a specific methodology. Unfortunately, the works considering methodologies are sparse and difficult to ease without prior knowledge about the target. This work proposes an automated way for deep learning hyperparameter tuning that is based on Bayesian Optimization. We build a custom framework denoted as AutoSCA that supports both machine learning and side-channel metrics. Our experimental analysis shows that Bayesian optimization performs well regardless of the dataset, leakage model, or neural network type. What is more, we find a number of neural network architectures outperforming state-of-the-art attacks. Finally, we note that random search, despite being considered not particularly powerful, manages to reach top performance for a number of considered settings. We postulate this happens since the datasets are relatively easy to break, and there are many neural network architectures reaching top performance.},

The results from the last few years show that deep learning techniques can efficiently break targets that are even protected with countermeasures. While there are constant improvements in making the deep learning-based attacks more powerful, little is done on evaluating such attacks' performance. Indeed, what is done today is not different from what was done more than a decade ago. This paper considers how to evaluate deep learning-based side-channel analysis and whether the commonly used techniques give the best results.

However, the effectiveness of these attacks strongly depends on the accuracy of underlying side-channel leakage characterization. Known leakage characterization models do not always apply into the real scenarios as they are working on some unrealistic assumptions about the leaking devices. In light of this, we propose a back propagation neural network based power leakage characterization attack for cryptographic devices. This attack makes full use of the intrinsic advantage of neural network in profiling non-linear mapping relationship as one basic machine learning tool, transforms the task of leakage profiling into a neural-network-supervised study process. In addition, two new attacks using this model have also been proposed, namely BP-CPA and BP-MIA.In order to justify the validity and accuracy of proposed attacks, we perform a series of experiments and carry out a detailed comparative study of them in multiple scenarios, with twelve typical attacks using mainstream power leakage characterization attacks, the results of which are measured by quantitative metrics such as SR, GE and DL. It has been turned out that BP neural network based power leakage characterization attack can largely improve the effectiveness of the attacks, regardless of the impact of noise and the limited number of power traces.Taking CPA only as one example, BP-CPA is 16.5\% better than existing non-linear leakage characterized based attacks with respect to DL, and is 154\% better than original CPA.},

Compared with template attacks, deep learning techniques can deal with trace misalignment and the high dimensionality of the data. Pre-processing is no longer mandatory. However, the performance of attacks depends to a great extent on the choice of each hyperparameter used to configure a CNN architecture. Hence, we cannot perfectly harness the potential of deep neural networks without a clear understanding of the network's inner-workings. To reduce this gap, we propose to clearly explain the role of each hyperparameters during the feature selection phase using some specific visualization techniques including Weight Visualization, Gradient Visualization and Heatmaps. By highlighting which features are retained by filters, heatmaps come in handy when a security evaluator tries to interpret and understand the efficiency of CNN. We propose a methodology for building efficient CNN architectures in terms of attack efficiency and network complexity, even in the presence of desynchronization. We evaluate our methodology using public datasets with and without desynchronization. In each case, our methodology outperforms the previous state-of-the-art CNN models while significantly reducing network complexity. Our networks are up to 25 times more efficient than previous state-of-the-art while their complexity is up to 31810 times smaller. Our results show that CNN networks do not need to be very complex to perform well in the side-channel context.},

  abstract = {Alpa automates model-parallel training of large deep learning (DL) models by generating execution plans that unify data, operator, and pipeline parallelism. Existing model-parallel training systems either require users to manually create a parallelization plan or automatically generate one from a limited space of model parallelism configurations, which does not suffice to scale out complex DL models on distributed compute devices. Alpa distributes the training of large DL models by viewing parallelisms as two hierarchical levels: inter-operator and intra-operator parallelisms. Based on it, Alpa constructs a new hierarchical space for massive model-parallel execution plans. Alpa designs a number of compilation passes to automatically derive the optimal parallel execution plan in each independent parallelism level and implements an efficient runtime to orchestrate the two-level parallel execution on distributed compute devices. Our evaluation shows Alpa generates parallelization plans that match or outperform hand-tuned model-parallel training systems even on models they are designed for. Unlike specialized systems, Alpa also generalizes to models with heterogeneous architectures and models without manually-designed plans.},

  abstract = {Recent years have witnessed the resurgence of knowledge engineering which is featured by the fast growth of knowledge graphs. However, most of existing knowledge graphs are represented with pure symbols, which hurts the machine's capability to understand the real world. The multi-modalization of knowledge graphs is an inevitable key step towards the realization of human-level machine intelligence. The results of this endeavor are Multi-modal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs). In this survey on MMKGs constructed by texts and images, we first give definitions of MMKGs, followed with the preliminaries on multi-modal tasks and techniques. We then systematically review the challenges, progresses and opportunities on the construction and application of MMKGs respectively, with detailed analyses of the strength and weakness of different solutions. We finalize this survey with open research problems relevant to MMKGs.},
