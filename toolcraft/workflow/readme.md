CWL is just a specification.
CWL can be used to write workflows.
These CWL workflows can be translated Airflow DAGs
Then we can edit these CWL in rabix composer https://github.com/rabix/composer


Rabix composer looks promising

 ... Like Dataset already what datasets are there ... for Model we can have a
  special class which reads python file to build Model based on custom python
   code ;)
